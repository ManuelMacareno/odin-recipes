    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Amish breakfast casserole has bacon, onion, eggs, hash browns, and lots of cheese. My family loves this
        hearty dish! Try breakfast sausage in place of bacon if you prefer. This crowd-pleasing Amish breakfast
        casserole recipe is not only hearty and filling, it’s made with budget-friendly ingredients you may already have
        on hand. </p>
